# CF_3_PythonProject
Conducted exploratory data analysis on Instacart’s customer and order data using Python to uncover shopping trends and segment customer behavior. Insights supported targeted marketing strategies and optimized ad timing and product recommendations.

## Instacart Market Segmentation & Sales Strategy: Python EDA Project

### Project Overview

Instacart is a leading online grocery delivery service seeking to gain deeper insights into customer purchasing behavior. As a data analyst, my role was to explore a large dataset of customer orders and demographics using Python to uncover patterns that can guide targeted marketing strategies and sales optimization. This project involved merging, cleaning, and analyzing multiple data sources to answer key business questions posed by marketing and sales stakeholders. The ultimate goal was to support a personalized customer experience and help Instacart make more informed decisions around ad placement, product recommendations, and customer segmentation.

### Business Questions Addressed

What are the busiest days and hours for customer orders?

At what times do customers spend the most money?

How can Instacart group products into simplified price ranges?

Which product types and departments are most frequently ordered?

What are the different types of customers based on behavior and demographics?

How loyal are they?

How do regions or age groups affect purchasing patterns?

What trends emerge based on income, family status, and order frequency?

### Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, os

Anaconda (environment & package management)

Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset (Kaggle)

Customer Data Set (synthetic for analysis)

### Analysis Workflow

Data Import & Cleaning: Loaded and inspected all datasets, handled missing data, and corrected data types.

Merging: Combined multiple datasets using unique identifiers and verified a 100% merge match.

Feature Engineering: Created new variables like price ranges, loyalty levels, and customer segments.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Used aggregation, grouping, and filtering to investigate customer and order behavior.

Visualization: Created clear, stakeholder-friendly charts showing trends by department, region, and customer type.

Insight Development: Answered business questions with actionable recommendations backed by data.

### Key Insights & Recommendations

Weekend mornings saw the highest order volumes, while customers spent the most in the evenings, suggesting distinct times for order activity vs. high-value purchases.

Products in the produce and dairy departments were most frequently purchased, highlighting areas for cross-promotion.

Loyal customers placed orders more frequently and spent more, suggesting loyalty-based promotions could drive retention.

Regional and demographic segments showed unique patterns in product preferences, reinforcing the need for targeted ads and personalized product suggestions.

### Ethics & Data Privacy

All customer data used was anonymized and aligned with ethical data handling practices. Synthetic demographic data was included for analysis and segmentation purposes.
